### Hi, I'm Rowan.

My pronouns are she/her. Welcome to my Github.

Please do not expect most things here to actually work. This is mostly just a place to help organize tiny little gems from the mountains of code that I write. Everything I post here is open source and you know the drill... use at your own ~~risk~~ peril ;)
